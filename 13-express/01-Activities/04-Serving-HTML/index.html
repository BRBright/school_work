          My name is Billy Joe Ray Bright. I am 26 years old and live in
          Sacramento Ca. I have lived in Illinois for two year with my father.
          While there I learned all of my work ethic. After living there with my
          father I moved back Cali to live with my mother where I enrolled and
          finished my jr. high school and high school career at Foot Hill High
          School.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation I enrolled in American River Collage. My major at the
          time was Commercial Music and Recording. I really liked the first few
          levels of the major but shortly found out that it was not for me.
          After figuring out that major was not me I got a job at Dairy Queen.
          While there I was taught how the work place is and customer service. I
          spent four years there starting from the bottom working my way up to
          Shift lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working at Dairy Queen for four year it was time to move on.
          After I left there I worked for Bed Bath and Beyond for a short time
          before I figured out that retail was not my cup of tea. So after
          figuring that out I got a job at Amazon. I had applied on a whim not
          really expecting to really get the job. But after a few days I got an
          email back telling me to got to new hire event. Then a few months
          later in October 2017 the building opened. They hired something like
          4000 people all at the same time plus it was also the begnning of the
          holiday season.
